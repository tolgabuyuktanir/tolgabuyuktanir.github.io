### Abstract

Predictive prefetching in client-server systems enhances data retrieval efficiency by forecasting user behavior. This research investigates navigational behavior modeling utilizing advanced embedding methods, including:  
- **Word Embedding**  
- **Node2Vec**  
- **Seq2Seq Models**  

Sequential user activity data is transformed into 64-dimensional vectors per activity. These vectors are averaged to create machine learning inputs. Experiments with classical ML techniques demonstrate significant reductions in latency, optimizing user experience through proactive data prefetching.
