   **Abstract:** Predictive prefetching in client-server systems improves data retrieval efficiency by anticipating user behavior. This study explores navigational behavior modeling using advanced embedding techniques such as word embedding, Node2Vec, and seq2seq models. The models are trained with sequential user activity data, creating 64-dimensional vectors for each activity, averaged to form machine learning inputs. Evaluations of various classical ML methods highlight the efficacy of the approach in reducing latency and enhancing user experience by prefetching required data proactively.
